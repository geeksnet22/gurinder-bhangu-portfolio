                good interpersonal and communication skills. I have a bachelor's degree in 
                computer science from the University of Saskatchewan with over a yearâ€™s 
                industry experience as a software developer. I enjoy everything programming 
                and often find myself learning tools and technologies I find exciting and 
                challenging. I have created several native and cross platform mobile apps mainly 
                in Java, Kotlin, React Native and Flutter. I am experienced in web development
